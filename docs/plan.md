# AI Task Manager - Implementation Plan

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Task Management (Week 1)
1. **Setup & Foundation**
   - [x] Initialize Next.js project structure
   - [ ] Setup basic UI components (task list, input, buttons)
   - [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations for tasks
   - [ ] Local storage integration

2. **Core Task Features**
   - [ ] Add task functionality
   - [ ] Mark complete/incomplete
   - [ ] Delete tasks
   - [ ] Basic task display

### Phase 2: AI Task Breakdown (Week 2)
1. **AI Integration Setup**
   - [ ] Choose and configure AI provider
   - [ ] Create API route for task breakdown
   - [ ] Implement loading states and error handling

2. **Task Breakdown Feature**
   - [ ] "Break Down" button for each task
   - [ ] AI prompt engineering for task breakdown
   - [ ] Display and manage subtasks
   - [ ] User acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions

### Phase 3: AI Day Planning (Week 2-3)
1. **Day Planning Logic**
   - [ ] "Plan My Day" global feature
   - [ ] AI prompt for day planning analysis
   - [ ] Display planning suggestions
   - [ ] Time estimation and priority logic

2. **Polish & Testing**
   - [ ] Error handling refinement
   - [ ] Mobile responsiveness
   - [ ] Performance optimization
   - [ ] User testing and feedback

## Technical Decisions Needed

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  parentId?: string; // For subtasks
  aiGenerated?: boolean;
  estimatedMinutes?: number;
}
```

### AI Integration - DECIDED: Gemini + Vercel AI SDK
**Choice Made**: Google Gemini with Vercel AI SDK
- Server-side API routes (secure)
- Fast setup and good documentation
- Cost-effective for MVP usage

**Setup Commands**:
```bash
pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/google
```

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### State Management - DECIDED: localStorage + React useState
**Choice Made**: Simple localStorage + React useState
- Fastest to implement
- No additional dependencies
- Perfect for MVP scope
- Easy to migrate later if needed

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI API failures**: Implement retry logic and fallback messages
- **Poor AI responses**: Add validation and user editing capabilities
- **Performance**: Implement loading states and optimize re-renders

### User Experience Risks
- **AI suggestions too generic**: Improve prompt engineering iteratively
- **Overwhelming subtasks**: Limit AI to 3-5 suggestions max
- **User confusion**: Add clear UI indicators for AI-generated content
